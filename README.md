## Abstract
```
Most reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for drone racing target fixed, obstacle-free tracks, leaving the generalization to unknown, cluttered environments largely unaddressed.  This challenge stems from the need to balance racing speed and collision avoidance, limited feasible space causing policy exploration trapped in local optima during training, and perceptual ambiguity between gates and obstacles in depth maps-especially when gate positions are only coarsely specified.
To overcome these issues, we propose a two-phase learning framework: an initial soft-collision training phase that preserves policy exploration for high-speed flight, followed by a hard-collision refinement phase that enforces robust obstacle avoidance. An adaptive, noise-augmented curriculum with an asymmetric actor-critic architecture gradually shifts the policy’s reliance from privileged gate-state information to depth-based visual input. We further impose Lipschitz constraints and integrate a track-primitive generator to enhance motion stability and cross-environment generalization.
We evaluate our framework through extensive simulation and ablation studies, and validate it in real-world experiments on a computationally constrained quadrotor. The system achieves agile flight while remaining robust to gate-position errors, developing a generalizable drone racing framework with the capability to operate in diverse, partially unknown and cluttered environments.

```bash
cd path_to_MasterRacing
conda activate virtual_environment (contain isaaclab repo)
bash ./install.sh
```
- Setup vscode.
```bash
python .vscode/tools/setup_vscode.py --isaac_path path_to_isaaclab_repo
```
- Verify installation.

```bash
# verify isaaclab installation
python standalone/rsl_rl/train.py --task=Template-Isaac-Velocity-Rough-Anymal-D-v0
```

- Training and evluation.
1. Click 'run and debug' button in vscode.
2. Drop down menu, select stage 0, and then click on start debugging.
3. See corrsponding options in [launch.json](https://github.com/MasterDroneRacing/MasterRacing/tree/main/.vscode/launch.json).

## Common Issues

**1.Pylance Missing Indexing of Extensions**

In some VsCode versions, the indexing of part of the extensions is missing. In this case, add the path to your extension in `.vscode/settings.json` under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`.

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "<path-to-ext-repo>/exts/MasterRacing"
    ]
}
```

**2.Pylance Crash**
If you encounter a crash in `pylance`, it is probable that too many files are indexed and you run out of memory.
A possible solution is to exclude some of omniverse packages that are not used in your project.
To do so, modify `.vscode/settings.json` and comment out packages under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`
Some examples of packages that can likely be excluded are:

```json
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.anim.*"         // Animation packages
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.kit.*"          // Kit UI tools
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.graph.*"        // Graph UI tools
"<path-to-isaac-sim>/extscache/omni.services.*"     // Services tools
...
```
